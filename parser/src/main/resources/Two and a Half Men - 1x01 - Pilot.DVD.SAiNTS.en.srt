1
00:00:02,285 --> 00:00:05,277
- So, what do you think?
- Wow.

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,789
It's for you, right?

3
00:00:09,893 --> 00:00:12,293
It's for both of us. Don't go away.

4
00:00:12,762 --> 00:00:16,163
Don't worry. There's not enough blood
left in my legs to go anywhere.

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,330
<i>Hey, it's Charlie.
Do your thing when you hear the beep.</i>

6
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:28,240
<i>Listen, you lousy S.O.B.,
I will not be treated like this.</i>

7
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:32,277
<i>Either you call me,
or you are gonna be very, very sorry.</i>

8
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:33,973
<i>I love you, Monkey Man.</i>

9
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:35,449
Charlie?

10
00:00:37,253 --> 00:00:38,686
Who was that?

11
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,449
Damn telemarketers.

12
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:43,489
A telemarketer who calls you
Monkey Man?

13
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,262
I'm on some weird list.

14
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:53,035
Okay, it's a woman I went out with once
and she got a little clingy.

15
00:00:53,169 --> 00:00:55,797
You are a bad, bad boy.

16
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,473
And yet, you're always the one
getting spanked.

17
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:03,175
Jeez.

18
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,014
<i>Hey, it's Charlie.
Do your thing when you hear the beep.</i>

19
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:11,043
<i>Charlie, it's Alan. Your brother.</i>

20
00:01:11,888 --> 00:01:14,982
<i>No big deal, just wanted to touch base.</i>

21
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:18,185
<i>My wife threw me out,
and I'm kind of losing the will to live.</i>

22
00:01:18,294 --> 00:01:21,559
<i>So, when you get a chance,
I'd really love to... I don't know...</i>

23
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,791
Alan, I'm sorry to hear about that.

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,862
So, where you gonna go, to a hotel? Wow.

25
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:33,175
Well, yeah, I guess you could stay here.

26
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:36,702
Okay. I'll see you when you get here.

27
00:01:37,914 --> 00:01:39,381
We better hurry.

28
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,883
Is she staying over?
Because I may have parked behind her.

29
00:01:59,836 --> 00:02:01,997
Twelve years, and she just throws me out.

30
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:04,164
I mean, what was the point
of our wedding vows?

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,334
You know, "Till death do us part. "
Who died? Not me. Not her.

32
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,907
How did you get in my house?

33
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:16,551
Okay, Charlie, the key in the fake rock
only works if it's among other rocks.

34
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:19,717
Not sitting on your welcome mat.

35
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:24,853
Excuse me, but if you put the fake rock
in with a bunch of other rocks,

36
00:02:24,928 --> 00:02:27,294
it's impossible to find when you're drunk.

37
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:30,965
You know, I'm a good husband.
I'm faithful.

38
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:32,626
- Is she?
- Is she what?

39
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:34,267
Faithful.

40
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:39,935
Don't be ridiculous.
Judith doesn't even like sex.

41
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:42,739
I mean, all she kept saying was
she feels suffocated, you know?

42
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:44,871
She kept going on and on,
"I'm suffocating. "

43
00:02:44,948 --> 00:02:48,111
What does that mean, you know?
Has a woman ever said that to you?

44
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:49,948
Well, yeah.

45
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,912
But not a woman who doesn't like sex.

46
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:59,085
And Jake. This could just destroy Jake.

47
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,556
- Jake?
- My son.

48
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:06,230
Teenagers are pretty sophisticated
these days.

49
00:03:06,302 --> 00:03:07,667
He's 10.

50
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:10,869
- Charlie, I'm going to go.
- No.

51
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,999
You two need to talk.
I'll call you tomorrow.

52
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,009
I'm sorry to hear about you and your wife.

53
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,239
Come on, you leaving isn't gonna
bring them back together again.

54
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,550
Look, okay,
this is just until things settle out.

55
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,453
A couple of days max.
She will come to her senses.

56
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,821
Yeah. That's what women do.

57
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,990
Look, you can have the guest room.
I'll grab some sheets.

58
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:36,190
That's okay. I brought my own.

59
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:39,794
You brought your own sheets?

60
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:41,131
I like my sheets.

61
00:03:43,339 --> 00:03:46,274
- Okay, then, good night.
- No, wait.

62
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,271
I mean, we hardly ever talk to each other.

63
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:52,346
What do you want to talk about, Alan?

64
00:03:52,548 --> 00:03:54,311
I don't know.

65
00:03:55,285 --> 00:03:57,116
I was named Chiropractor of the Year

66
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:59,814
by the San Fernando
Valley Chiropractic Association.

67
00:04:00,857 --> 00:04:02,950
- Okay, then. Good night.
- No.

68
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:04,459
Charlie, what about you?

69
00:04:05,728 --> 00:04:07,218
What's going on with you?

70
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,630
Well, Alan, there's not much to say.

71
00:04:09,899 --> 00:04:12,493
I make a lot of money
for doing very little work.

72
00:04:12,568 --> 00:04:15,662
I sleep with beautiful women
who don't ask about my feelings.

73
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,000
I drive a Jag, I live at the beach,

74
00:04:18,074 --> 00:04:21,339
and sometimes in the middle of the day,
for no reason at all,

75
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:24,141
I like to make myself
a big pitcher of margaritas

76
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:25,874
and take a nap out on the sundeck.

77
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:34,350
- Okay, then. Good night, Charlie.
- Good night.

78
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,718
Good night, Monkey Man.

79
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,706
Boy, is your eye red.

80
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:57,172
You should see it from in here.

81
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:01,042
What are you doing here, Jake?

82
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:02,584
My mom brought me.

83
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:05,044
Will you take me swimming in the ocean?

84
00:05:06,456 --> 00:05:09,084
Can we talk about it
after my head stops exploding?

85
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,452
Why is your head exploding?

86
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:16,588
Well, I drank a little too much wine
last night.

87
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,933
If it makes you feel bad,
why do you drink it?

88
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,535
Nobody likes a wiseass, Jake.

89
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:28,605
You have to put $1 in the swear jar.
You said "ass. "

90
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,879
Tell you what,

91
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:34,246
here's $20.
That should cover me till lunch.

92
00:05:35,952 --> 00:05:39,149
Now, what I think you need to do
is to make a list.

93
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:42,088
On one side, put what you don't like
about our marriage,

94
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:43,819
and on the other side, what you do.

95
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,656
Alan, sometimes when I think
about coming home to you,

96
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,424
I start crying in my car.

97
00:05:51,234 --> 00:05:53,725
Okay, that would probably
go on the "don't" side.

98
00:05:54,404 --> 00:05:57,305
Why would I lie?
The ocean is closed today.

99
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,608
For God's sake, do you think
you could put some pants on?

100
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:04,510
Look at me, Judy.
I could barely make it down the stairs.

101
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,246
Charlie, could you and Jake...

102
00:06:08,317 --> 00:06:11,013
Yeah, come on, kid,
we'll have breakfast out on the deck.

103
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,587
I already had breakfast.

104
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:14,987
- Okay, we'll have lunch.
- It's not lunchtime.

105
00:06:18,361 --> 00:06:19,919
That's his head exploding.

106
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:24,261
Judith, I can change.

107
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:27,469
Please, Alan.
You are the most rigid, inflexible,

108
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:29,869
obsessive, anal-retentive man
I've ever met.

109
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,599
Rigid and inflexible?

110
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:36,937
Don't you think that's a little redundant?

111
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:52,354
My mom and dad are splitting up.

112
00:06:52,628 --> 00:06:54,391
Yeah. It looks that way.

113
00:06:55,698 --> 00:06:56,892
You're lucky.

114
00:06:57,467 --> 00:07:00,994
When I was your age, I could only dream
about my parents splitting up.

115
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,867
- Your mom is my grandma.
- Yep.

116
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:07,638
Grandma says
you're a bitter disappointment.

117
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:13,375
Hey, sport,
your mom wants to say goodbye.

118
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,485
Listen, he doesn't know anything
about what's going on,

119
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:22,490
so let's just keep this to ourselves.

120
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,994
Our little secret.
Why is she saying goodbye to him?

121
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,027
She's gonna be spending the weekend
with her sister in Vegas.

122
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:34,167
So, we decided that
Jake would stay with me.

123
00:07:34,737 --> 00:07:35,931
With you?

124
00:07:36,739 --> 00:07:38,104
Well, with us.

125
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:40,335
I'm hungry.

126
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:41,876
Is this gonna be a problem?

127
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:50,582
I guess not.

128
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:53,820
Thanks. Listen, I've got to call my office.

129
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,687
Would you mind making him lunch?

130
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:00,752
- Sure.
- Thanks.

131
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:05,800
What are you smiling about?

132
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,460
You don't have any food.

133
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:11,031
Yeah, but I'm not the one who's hungry.

134
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:14,402
Who's smiling now, shorty?

135
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,439
- You drink milk?
- Just with cereal.

136
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:24,614
- Okay.
- Not that milk. That milk.

137
00:08:26,656 --> 00:08:30,387
- What's the difference?
- That's Dairy Farm. We drink Dairy Barn.

138
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,496
Fine. Happy?

139
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:39,497
Why would I be happy? It's just milk.

140
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,740
Cute. Keep it up,
you'll be on one of the cartons.

141
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:52,241
Okay, cereal.

142
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:55,978
We got Lucky Charms, Cocoa Puffs,
Frosted Flakes and Maple Loops.

143
00:08:56,085 --> 00:08:57,416
I want Maple Loops.

144
00:09:06,929 --> 00:09:08,191
You know who wrote that song?

145
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:10,095
- Your uncle Charlie wrote that.
- No lie?

146
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,566
<i>If I was to lie, I'd say I wrote
Stairway to Heaven,</i>

147
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,102
not the Maple Loops song.

148
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,671
- You two are really good together.
- Thank you.

149
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:21,000
So, does your wife sing, too?

150
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:24,741
- No, I'm not married.
- What a shame.

151
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:32,518
Wow. You're even better than a dog.

152
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,356
Dr. Bloom? Yes, this is Alan Harper.

153
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,794
My wife and I need to cancel our marriage
counseling appointment for this afternoon.

154
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:48,166
Yes, well, something came up.

155
00:09:49,472 --> 00:09:52,305
Well, it's kind of personal. I mean...

156
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,602
Well, yeah,
I know the point of these things is...

157
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,277
I've got to go.

158
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,709
- Hello?
- Is Charlie home?

159
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:05,715
No. I'm Charlie's brother. Can I help you?

160
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:10,556
Hi, Charlie's brother. I'm Rose.

161
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:12,657
I'm Charlie's housekeeper.

162
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,387
So, you're a housekeeper?

163
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:18,160
Housekeeper /actress/hand model.

164
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:21,769
I just do this to keep the wolf
from the door.

165
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,071
You know what I mean?

166
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:28,337
Sure. Come on in.

167
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:35,307
Yeah, I can smell him.

168
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,918
Smell who?

169
00:10:38,988 --> 00:10:42,014
Your brother. He has a very musky scent.

170
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,392
Well, I'll just let you get to work.

171
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,428
Wait.

172
00:10:57,173 --> 00:10:58,504
No. It's okay.

173
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,246
Jake, buddy. Take a break.

174
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:11,380
What took you so long?

175
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:14,281
We stopped for ice cream
because I'm a babe magnet.

176
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:18,559
I got to take a squirt.

177
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:23,858
Why do you assume
he learned that from me?

178
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,596
Because I learned it from you.

179
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:32,732
- Hey, thanks for cleaning up.
- No, it wasn't me. Rose was here.

180
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:35,800
Rose? You let Rose into my house?

181
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:37,569
She said she was your maid.

182
00:11:38,214 --> 00:11:40,944
Hell, she glued the damn cabinets
shut again.

183
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:43,143
Again?

184
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:46,313
You've got somebody who comes in
regularly to glue your cabinets?

185
00:11:46,422 --> 00:11:48,913
You've met some of the whack jobs
I've gone out with.

186
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:51,824
- It's not that big a stretch.
- So, this is my fault?

187
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:53,255
Who let her in?

188
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:56,162
You're a deeply disturbed man,
you know? Move it. Come on.

189
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:57,664
I'm deeply disturbed?

190
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,736
Who came here in the middle
of the night with his own sheets?

191
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:04,068
At least, I care what I sleep on.
Or should I say, who I sleep on.

192
00:12:05,107 --> 00:12:06,802
Hey, pal, of the two of us,

193
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:10,276
I'll bet I'm the only one who's slept
with a married woman recently.

194
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:12,644
And isn't that something to brag about?

195
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,648
Hi, Mom.

196
00:12:20,256 --> 00:12:22,724
Do you have any idea how hurtful it is

197
00:12:22,792 --> 00:12:25,920
to hear about your own son's divorce
on the street?

198
00:12:26,262 --> 00:12:28,025
What divorce? What street?

199
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,329
How did you get in my house?

200
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:33,463
You stay out of this.

201
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:36,596
I'm here to help your brother
through a very difficult time.

202
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,364
How could you do this to me?

203
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:41,468
Do what?

204
00:12:41,544 --> 00:12:43,535
Now when I want to see my grandson

205
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:46,376
I am going to have to make
an appointment with Judith,

206
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:48,883
who, let's face it,
was never very warm to me.

207
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:52,381
And what if there's another man there?
Shacking up with her?

208
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,846
Have we even stopped to consider that?

209
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:01,625
I think he's considering it now, Mom.

210
00:13:02,798 --> 00:13:05,790
- Here's your iced tea, Grandma.
- Thank you, my little angel.

211
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,836
Darling, I asked for a lemon wedge.

212
00:13:11,574 --> 00:13:13,633
All right. Here's what you're going to do.

213
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,836
You and Jake will come live with me.

214
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:19,808
After all, I'm just rattling around
in that big house all by myself.

215
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:23,777
That's very considerate, but as soon as
Judith and I work things out,

216
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:25,514
I'm going to be back at my own house.

217
00:13:25,588 --> 00:13:27,579
Sweetheart, grow up.

218
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:31,349
Think about what I said.

219
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:35,356
You're my son, and I'll always have room
for you in my house

220
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,164
and in my heart.

221
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,531
I love you, too, Mom.

222
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:54,071
- I love you, too, Mom.
- Too little. Too late.

223
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,051
- So, Vegas was good?
- It was fine.

224
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:03,352
Alan, I really want to apologize
for putting you through this.

225
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,620
I was wrong to blame you
for my unhappiness.

226
00:14:05,728 --> 00:14:07,252
No, no need to apologize.

227
00:14:07,363 --> 00:14:10,662
What's important is that we're here
and we're working on our marriage.

228
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:11,995
You look great, by the way.

229
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,729
Must be all the extra oxygen
they pump into the casinos.

230
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:16,532
- Alan...
- And you were right.

231
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,369
I see now that the time apart
did us both a lot of good.

232
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,567
I know I've grown.

233
00:14:20,643 --> 00:14:23,373
I'm not that suffocating guy
you threw out of the house

234
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,413
four and a half days ago,
let me tell you that.

235
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:26,675
Jake's doing fine.

236
00:14:26,749 --> 00:14:29,081
You were concerned about him
being around my brother,

237
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:30,812
but Charlie's great with kids.

238
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,953
All right, last card, down and dirty.

239
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:36,918
King's bet.

240
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,125
- $1.
- I'm in.

241
00:14:39,228 --> 00:14:40,422
In.

242
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,393
I'll see $1 and raise it $5.

243
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:48,798
You raised $5 on that?

244
00:14:48,904 --> 00:14:50,428
- I call.
- I call.

245
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,572
Queens full of nines.

246
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,071
Kid, don't you know what a full house is?

247
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,411
Yeah. And I also know what a psych-out is.

248
00:15:02,284 --> 00:15:03,683
I love this boy.

249
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,352
And I think we're gonna look back on this
as a new beginning for our marriage.

250
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:11,290
A rebirth. A renaissance, if you will.

251
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,918
Alan, I think I'm gay.

252
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:18,460
All right.

253
00:15:20,703 --> 00:15:22,170
We'll make a list.

254
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:25,964
On one side, we'll put gay stuff...

255
00:15:26,942 --> 00:15:28,432
I'll see you

256
00:15:29,945 --> 00:15:31,435
and raise you $20.

257
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:38,180
- I think he's got you, pal.
- He's bluffing.

258
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:41,115
He always pulls his ear when he bluffs.

259
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:44,989
How about it, Mighty Mouse? You in?

260
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:48,660
Take him down.

261
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:54,728
Call you.

262
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:57,294
I hate this kid.

263
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:01,403
What the hell is going on here?

264
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,908
You said "hell. "

265
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:06,838
- Throw $1 in the pot.
- What?

266
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:08,908
Hey, we all had to.

267
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,545
Charlie, may I speak with you
privately, please?

268
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,487
- Whose deal is it?
- Jake, go to bed!

269
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,718
I'm out.

270
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,425
What is wrong with you? Are you insane?

271
00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:22,394
Do you have any sense
of right and wrong?

272
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:24,261
Probably not. How was dinner?

273
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:27,028
How could you put Jake in a poker game
with grown men?

274
00:16:27,102 --> 00:16:29,161
I obviously can't be trusted.

275
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,331
So, how was dinner?

276
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,706
I leave you alone with him
for a couple of hours...

277
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:36,472
I'm just gonna keep asking, Alan.

278
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:39,571
Dinner was swell. We both had
the veal piccata and she's gay!

279
00:16:42,785 --> 00:16:44,116
Wow.

280
00:16:45,521 --> 00:16:46,954
Most chicks won't eat veal.

281
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,551
Why do I even try talking to you?

282
00:16:51,627 --> 00:16:54,221
Come on, I'm just trying to get you
to lighten up a little.

283
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:56,958
I don't need to lighten up.
The world I live in is dark.

284
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,294
Dark and rainy.

285
00:16:58,467 --> 00:17:00,094
And you're useless in it!

286
00:17:00,202 --> 00:17:03,638
Really? I wasn't useless
when you needed a place to stay.

287
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,104
Obviously that was a mistake.

288
00:17:06,575 --> 00:17:07,974
Are you sure?

289
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:10,640
Maybe we should make a list.

290
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,625
Uncle Charlie?

291
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:30,154
What's going on? Can't sleep?

292
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:32,159
No.

293
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,062
My dad says we're moving
to Grandma's tomorrow.

294
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,072
Yeah, that'd keep me up.

295
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,638
If it makes you feel any better,
you won $80 on that last hand.

296
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:45,907
$85.

297
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,915
$80. The house gets a cut.

298
00:17:49,785 --> 00:17:51,810
I wish my dad was as cool as you.

299
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,053
Don't sell your dad short.

300
00:17:54,123 --> 00:17:56,284
He loves you
more than anything in the world.

301
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:57,791
You know that, don't you?

302
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,521
I guess.

303
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,926
How come you don't have any kids?

304
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,064
I don't know.

305
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:12,301
Maybe because I love me
more than anything in the world.

306
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,603
- Uncle Charlie?
- Yeah?

307
00:18:17,412 --> 00:18:20,074
I don't want to go to Grandma's.
I'd rather stay here.

308
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,817
Yeah, well, your dad knows
what's best for you.

309
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:30,457
Okay. Good night, Uncle Charlie.
I love you.

310
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:36,261
Yeah. Okay.

311
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:48,040
You got to love a kid like that.

312
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:50,377
<i>I even played him Stairway to Heaven</i>

313
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:53,107
and he still liked
the Maple Loops song better.

314
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:55,616
Charlie, I haven't seen you in two weeks.

315
00:18:55,684 --> 00:18:57,618
You finally got the house back to yourself.

316
00:18:57,686 --> 00:19:01,281
Now, do you want to talk about
your nephew, or do you want to have sex?

317
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:02,823
Sex. Definitely sex.

318
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:11,495
- Let me ask you something.
- Yeah?

319
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:14,628
Do you ever think about having kids?

320
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:18,161
Whoa, we've got a good thing going.
Can't we just leave it at that?

321
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,572
What are you doing?
I thought we were gonna have sex.

322
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:24,169
How am I supposed to have sex
while your biological clock is going off?

323
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:31,211
<i>Hey, it's Charlie.
Do your thing when you hear the beep.</i>

324
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,745
<i>Hi, Monkey Man.</i>

325
00:19:36,024 --> 00:19:38,083
<i>I was just thinking about you</i>

326
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,924
<i>and wondering why we hurt each other
so much.</i>

327
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:43,897
Rose, it's me, Monkey Man.

328
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,267
<i>- Charlie?
- Yeah, listen, let me ask you a question.</i>

329
00:19:48,737 --> 00:19:50,728
Is there something
inherently wrong with

330
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,501
asking a woman you're involved with
if she wants kids?

331
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:57,209
<i>Charlie, we got a good thing going,
why do you want to mess it up?</i>

332
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:05,118
Look at you.
All grown up and back living with Mom.

333
00:20:06,188 --> 00:20:08,281
How good do you feel about yourself
right now?

334
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:11,018
On a scale of one to two.

335
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:13,794
I'm not back living with Mom.

336
00:20:13,896 --> 00:20:16,831
I'm simply staying here
till Judith and I work things out.

337
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:18,628
So, one?

338
00:20:20,369 --> 00:20:21,700
What do you want, Charlie?

339
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,034
I figured you've been here
a couple of weeks,

340
00:20:24,106 --> 00:20:26,404
you got to have blood
in your stool by now.

341
00:20:32,915 --> 00:20:36,874
So, I thought if you and Jake wanted
to come back to my place for a while,

342
00:20:36,952 --> 00:20:38,715
- that'd be okay.
- Wait a minute.

343
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:41,483
Are you saying you want me
to come back and live with you?

344
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,558
Well, truthfully, no.

345
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:46,652
I want Jake to come back
and live with me,

346
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:48,559
but I figure you're a package deal.

347
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:51,599
Thanks, but we're doing just fine
here with Mom.

348
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,164
Come on. We can't let Jake be exposed
to her on any kind of ongoing basis.

349
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:58,739
There's no ongoing basis.
He's only here on weekends.

350
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,172
That's too much.

351
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:03,976
Piranhas can strip an entire cow
in an hour.

352
00:21:05,647 --> 00:21:09,310
Alan, we've got to get him away from her.
I mean, look what happened to us.

353
00:21:09,785 --> 00:21:11,616
And what happened to you?

354
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:13,618
Hi, Mom.

355
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:16,116
Charlie, you're a grown man.

356
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:19,854
Perhaps it's time to stop blaming
your mother for your own shortcomings.

357
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:21,896
Alan, the divan is not for sitting.

358
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:23,693
Charlie, get off the couch.

359
00:21:25,434 --> 00:21:26,662
Uncle Charlie.

360
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:29,000
There's my good boy.

361
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:31,932
And what did I tell you
about yelling in the house?

362
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,701
Grandma, I'm suffocating.

363
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:37,176
Sound familiar?

364
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:39,845
You're right, this madness must end.

365
00:21:41,683 --> 00:21:43,981
Here, I got you your own key.

366
00:21:51,693 --> 00:21:55,254
I am not comfortable with this.
I mean, maybe I should go wait in the car.

367
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,797
You're not waiting in the car.

368
00:21:56,865 --> 00:21:58,799
Trust me, this is a great way
to meet women.

369
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:00,960
I don't want to meet women.
I'm still married.

370
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:03,937
Come on, your wife's out meeting chicks,
why shouldn't you?

371
00:22:11,546 --> 00:22:13,377
Your son is just adorable.

372
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:16,150
- Thank you.
- You and your

373
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:18,512
life partner must be so proud.

374
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:26,553
You're right. Go wait in the car.

375
00:22:52,087 --> 00:22:53,281
