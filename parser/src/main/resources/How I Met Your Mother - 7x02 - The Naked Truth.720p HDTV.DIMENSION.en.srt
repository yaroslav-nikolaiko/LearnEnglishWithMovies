1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,765
Oh, God, guys, I'm
still really hungover.

2
00:00:03,769 --> 00:00:05,135
Did I really
ruin a wedding?

3
00:00:05,137 --> 00:00:07,504
No, you didn't ruin
a wedding.

4
00:00:07,506 --> 00:00:08,906
Just the reception.

5
00:00:08,908 --> 00:00:10,841
And the bar mitzvah next door.

6
00:00:10,843 --> 00:00:12,526
And my dress.

7
00:00:12,528 --> 00:00:14,778
And your dress. You put on
a dress at one point.

8
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,114
Okay, you know what,
that's it.

9
00:00:17,116 --> 00:00:19,783
I'm about to be a dad,
and I want to be

10
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:22,435
the kind of man that my
child can look up to.

11
00:00:22,437 --> 00:00:24,905
So, sweeping declaration--

12
00:00:24,907 --> 00:00:29,209
I am never getting drunk again
as long as I live.

13
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,277
I'm serious.

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,764
<i>Kids, it's not that</i>
<i>your Uncle Marshall</i>

15
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:35,065
<i>had a drinking problem.</i>

16
00:00:35,067 --> 00:00:37,184
But whenever he made a sweeping
<i>declaration like that,</i>

17
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:39,019
<i>you pretty much knew...</i>

18
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:41,888
I did it again.

19
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,174
<i>But I'm getting ahead</i>
<i>of myself.</i>

20
00:00:45,393 --> 00:00:47,344
What happened
to your leg?

21
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:48,812
Oh, nothing.

22
00:00:48,814 --> 00:00:50,514
I'm meeting Nora
for coffee.

23
00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:52,933
She's still mad at me, so
I need some sympathy points.

24
00:00:52,935 --> 00:00:54,300
She likes musicals,
so I'm going

25
00:00:54,302 --> 00:00:55,802
to tell her I fell off the stage

26
00:00:55,804 --> 00:00:57,521
during a performance
of <i>Man of La Mancha.</i>

27
00:00:57,523 --> 00:00:58,638
What do you think?

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,273
Lose the cast.

29
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:02,909
A one-man show-- I like it!

30
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:05,112
Just so we're clear--

31
00:01:05,114 --> 00:01:08,332
this woman is mad at you
because you lied to her.

32
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:11,118
So your solution is to pretend
you broke your leg?

33
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,203
You're right.

34
00:01:13,205 --> 00:01:15,372
A neck brace.
Thanks, Lil.

35
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:17,674
Man, I wish I'd have talked
to you sooner.

36
00:01:17,676 --> 00:01:19,309
I've been practicing
with these crutches all day

37
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:21,345
and whoever left them
in my lobby

38
00:01:21,347 --> 00:01:22,462
probably really
needs 'em.

39
00:01:22,464 --> 00:01:24,664
Well, uh, I have
some good news.

40
00:01:24,666 --> 00:01:28,051
As you all know, I recently
decided to get back out there

41
00:01:28,053 --> 00:01:30,954
and start dating again.
And, uh, well...

42
00:01:34,609 --> 00:01:36,626
Is this you?

43
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:39,730
Uh, yeah. Hi.

44
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:40,864
I'm Ted.

45
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:42,132
- Hi.
- Hi.

46
00:01:42,134 --> 00:01:44,284
That's great, Ted.

47
00:01:44,286 --> 00:01:46,186
Yeah. Yeah, it was a moment
of pure destiny.

48
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:48,655
The kind you just
can't manufacture.

49
00:01:48,657 --> 00:01:50,690
Or so I thought.

50
00:01:53,661 --> 00:01:56,696
Oh, no.
How did I get on there?

51
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:58,648
Hi. Ted Mosby.

52
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,867
Guilty.

53
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:02,669
Hi. Ted Mosby.

54
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:04,421
That is embarrassing.

55
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:08,642
I should be on the cover of
<i>Egg On My Face</i> magazine.

56
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:09,843
But I'm not.

57
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:11,978
I'm on the cover of this one.

58
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,131
Hi. Ted Mosby.

59
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:16,149
16 moments of pure destiny

60
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:18,852
in one day,
and of those 16,

61
00:02:18,854 --> 00:02:20,937
ten were single.

62
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:24,107
Of those ten,
seven liked what they saw.

63
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:25,759
Of those seven,

64
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:27,727
four were women.

65
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:30,080
Of those four,

66
00:02:30,082 --> 00:02:31,364
two gave me their real number.

67
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:34,167
And I have a date
with both of them.

68
00:02:34,169 --> 00:02:35,952
Okay.

69
00:02:37,705 --> 00:02:39,005
Guys,

70
00:02:39,007 --> 00:02:40,640
it's Garrison Cootes.

71
00:02:40,642 --> 00:02:42,592
<i>Kids, Garrison Cootes</i>
<i>was a senior partner</i>

72
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:44,244
<i>at Honeywell & Cootes.</i>

73
00:02:44,246 --> 00:02:45,796
<i>One of the biggest</i>
<i>environmental law firms</i>

74
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,230
<i>in America.</i>

75
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:49,299
<i>Marshall would have given</i>
<i>anything to work there.</i>

76
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:51,635
If I don't get this job,
I might end up working

77
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:52,853
at, like, a Taco Bell somewhere.

78
00:02:52,855 --> 00:02:54,354
And nobody wants that.

79
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:57,040
Or maybe you guys want that,
because you'll get free tacos,

80
00:02:57,042 --> 00:02:58,391
'cause your my peeps.

81
00:02:58,393 --> 00:03:01,812
But right now I need
all of you to calm down!

82
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:05,532
Hello.

83
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:07,200
Marshall, this is
Garrison Cootes.

84
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:09,035
Sorry I didn't get back
to you sooner,

85
00:03:09,037 --> 00:03:11,238
but I've just been swamped.

86
00:03:12,574 --> 00:03:15,275
Which is funny,
'cause I'm literally

87
00:03:15,277 --> 00:03:17,077
standing in a swamp.

88
00:03:18,914 --> 00:03:22,082
Anyway, I'm just out here,
I'm just collecting some samples

89
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:24,284
for this pollution case
we're working on.

90
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:26,253
I love the work you guys do.
That's a croc...

91
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:27,305
No, I mean it.

92
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,767
No, no, there's a crocodile
about five feet away from me.

93
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:31,308
So I'm just going to ignore

94
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,560
the hot urine filling
my waders as we speak,

95
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:35,962
and tell you that
we're very interested.

96
00:03:35,964 --> 00:03:36,963
He's interested.

97
00:03:36,965 --> 00:03:38,648
Obviously we have
to do some sort

98
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,934
of credit check, you know,
a criminal record

99
00:03:40,936 --> 00:03:43,570
and Google search, but as long
as nothing unseemly turns up,

100
00:03:43,572 --> 00:03:44,938
you're good to go, man.

101
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,857
That is fantastic, Mr. Cootes!

102
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,241
Well, I gotta run.

103
00:03:49,912 --> 00:03:51,444
This is so funny,

104
00:03:51,446 --> 00:03:55,248
because, actually, I physically
have to run now.

105
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,498
- Croc saw you?
- He's advancing, yeah.

<i>Thankfully, without</i>

110
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:19,606
Hey, Nora, thanks
for meeting me here.

111
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:20,757
What happened to your neck?

112
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,176
My wha...? Oh, it's nothing.

113
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:26,512
I was performing in
a one-man show of <i>Fiddler.</i>

114
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,281
There was this roof.

115
00:04:28,283 --> 00:04:30,500
Wow, that one has
fantastic ta-tas.

116
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:31,651
What, where?

117
00:04:31,653 --> 00:04:32,869
Oh... Oh, damn it.

118
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:34,004
Ta-ta.

119
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:36,189
Wait, Nora, wait...
No, look, please don't.

120
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,190
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

121
00:04:37,192 --> 00:04:38,592
What is the matter with you?

122
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:40,627
What kind of person
needs to lie like that.

123
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:43,363
A person who really,
really likes you.

124
00:04:43,365 --> 00:04:45,632
And suspects,
probably accurately,

125
00:04:45,634 --> 00:04:47,217
that you're way
out of his league,

126
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:49,469
and so he feels the need to...

127
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:52,672
I'm sorry, you were kidding

128
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:54,057
about the fantastic
ta-tas, right?

129
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:55,197
'Cause I'm looking around
and I do not see 'em...

130
00:04:58,263 --> 00:05:00,063
I just had two
back-to-back dates.

131
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:02,732
That's right,
two lovely ladies,

132
00:05:02,734 --> 00:05:06,736
four large cappuccinos,
and... one sec.

133
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,907
And I don't know which
date was more awesome.

134
00:05:10,909 --> 00:05:12,576
Let's meet the girls.

135
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:14,861
<i>Jessica is a Rhodes scholar.</i>

136
00:05:14,863 --> 00:05:16,396
<i>She's traveled</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

137
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:19,065
<i>Speaks four languages,</i>
<i>is a concert pianist.</i>

138
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:22,852
<i>And Claire reached</i>
<i>for the check.</i>

139
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:23,970
So I don't know.

140
00:05:23,972 --> 00:05:25,305
It's a squeaker.

141
00:05:25,307 --> 00:05:26,573
I mean, both
of these girls

142
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:29,426
have the potential to be
something really special.

143
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:31,380
They both move
on to the next round.

144
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,363
Wait a minute.

145
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:34,381
You're going to date
two girls at once?

146
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:36,132
Don't you think you should
just choose one

147
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:37,267
before it gets serious?

148
00:05:37,269 --> 00:05:38,351
Define serious.

149
00:05:38,353 --> 00:05:40,086
Well, that's complicated.

150
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:42,472
I guess you have to weigh
expectations,

151
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:43,723
emotional investments...

152
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:44,991
Third base.

153
00:05:44,993 --> 00:05:46,393
Seriously, third base.

154
00:05:46,395 --> 00:05:48,862
So I can go to second base with
both of these girls, no problem?

155
00:05:48,864 --> 00:05:51,081
Oh, honk away, my friend.
Yeah, honk away.

156
00:05:51,765 --> 00:05:53,316
Oh, no.

157
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:55,518
Ever since Mr. Cootes mentioned
<i>the background check,</i>

158
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,587
<i>Marshall had been</i>
<i>scouring the Internet.</i>

159
00:05:57,589 --> 00:06:00,040
<i>Most of what he found</i>
<i>was pretty harmless.</i>

160
00:06:00,042 --> 00:06:03,276
<i>In some cases,</i>
<i>really awesome, until...</i>

161
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:04,411
Not good.

162
00:06:04,413 --> 00:06:06,913
This-- this is not good.

163
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:09,382
Thanks, Stacy.

164
00:06:09,384 --> 00:06:11,635
Wesleyan has a new cafeteria,

165
00:06:11,637 --> 00:06:13,586
thanks to the generous
endowment from--

166
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:14,971
Oh, ho-ho!

167
00:06:14,973 --> 00:06:18,174
Did somebody say
generous endowment?

168
00:06:18,176 --> 00:06:24,814
I'm Marshall Eriksen, but you
can call me Beercules!

169
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:34,640
Well, that could
be anybody.

170
00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:41,184
Oh, man, I forgot
about Beercules.

171
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:43,622
Who made this
Web site anyway?

172
00:06:43,624 --> 00:06:46,067
- Pete Durkenson.
- Of course.

173
00:06:46,068 --> 00:06:49,212
Is that the guy who convinced
you to run across campus naked?

174
00:06:49,213 --> 00:06:51,130
I was pledging his frat,

175
00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:53,215
which I gave up on
after three days,

176
00:06:53,217 --> 00:06:55,701
because frats are stupid
and elitist

177
00:06:55,703 --> 00:06:58,203
and also I found out
he wasn't in a frat.

178
00:06:58,205 --> 00:07:00,255
Oh, my God.

179
00:07:00,257 --> 00:07:01,557
This is awesome.

180
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:04,276
I just got invited
to the Architects' Ball,

181
00:07:04,278 --> 00:07:07,729
the annual gala that honors
the city's greatest architects.

182
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:10,899
Oh, no, you guys see
why this sucks, right?

183
00:07:10,901 --> 00:07:12,568
Because it's an annual gala

184
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,153
honoring the city's
greatest architects?

185
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:17,873
Robin, this is the social event
of the year.

186
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,242
You take a girl
to the Architects' Ball,

187
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:22,611
brother, you're going
to third base.

188
00:07:22,613 --> 00:07:23,912
Whichever girl

189
00:07:23,914 --> 00:07:25,414
I take as my date,

190
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,333
she will be
Miss Ted Mosby's girlfriend

191
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:29,902
by the end of the night.

192
00:07:31,037 --> 00:07:32,921
Okay, no more sitting
on the fence.

193
00:07:32,923 --> 00:07:35,090
Robin, get me my legal pad.

194
00:07:35,092 --> 00:07:37,092
It's pros and cons time!

195
00:07:38,562 --> 00:07:41,697
And kids, they really cheered.

196
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,982
Let me make one thing
very clear to you.

197
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:46,952
I don't date guys who lie to me.

198
00:07:46,954 --> 00:07:49,154
Well, see, I did not
know that.

199
00:07:49,156 --> 00:07:50,305
My bad.

200
00:07:50,307 --> 00:07:52,274
So, from here on in,
no more lies.

201
00:07:52,276 --> 00:07:55,177
I will never lie
to you again.

202
00:07:56,012 --> 00:07:57,613
I'm serious. Ask me anything.

203
00:07:57,615 --> 00:08:00,048
Okay.

204
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,116
Have you ever successfully

205
00:08:01,118 --> 00:08:03,502
gotten a woman in bed
by lying to her?

206
00:08:03,504 --> 00:08:06,121
Have I ever...

207
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:12,711
If I'm being totally honest...

208
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:16,215
Yes.

209
00:08:16,217 --> 00:08:18,133
More than once?

210
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:20,469
More than once...

211
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:22,554
Wow, that's...

212
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:27,559
I guess if we're
splitting hairs,

213
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:31,396
then, technically...
there was a plurality

214
00:08:31,398 --> 00:08:35,701
to the times I've lied to women
for sex having purposes.

215
00:08:35,703 --> 00:08:36,919
What were they?

216
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:38,921
Nines and tens mostly.

217
00:08:38,923 --> 00:08:40,572
There was a four once.

218
00:08:40,574 --> 00:08:41,957
She was a slump buster.

219
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:45,577
But, Nora, after that, I had a
run that you would not believe.

220
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:48,046
Man, honesty feels good.

221
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:49,731
What were the lies?

222
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:52,334
You want me to tell you every
lie I've ever told a woman

223
00:08:52,336 --> 00:08:53,502
to get her into bed?

224
00:08:53,504 --> 00:08:56,221
A bed or any other place
you had sex with her.

225
00:08:56,223 --> 00:08:57,456
Oh, you're good.

226
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:00,809
Pete, Pete. Hey.

227
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:02,928
Beercules!

228
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,212
Bring it in, dude.

229
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:06,348
Hey, I've been
trying to call you,

230
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,716
like, all night.

231
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:08,984
Oh, my God, sorry.

232
00:09:08,986 --> 00:09:10,986
I would have answered,
but it is Tuesday night.

233
00:09:10,988 --> 00:09:11,820
It's Sunday.

234
00:09:11,822 --> 00:09:13,605
And you know what that means.

235
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:15,691
"Edward Forty Hands."

236
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:17,759
<i>Kids, "Edward Forty Hands"</i>

237
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:20,229
is a game that involves taping
<i>two 40-ounce bottles</i>

238
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:22,564
<i>of malt liquor to your hands.</i>

239
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,299
<i>The object is to finish</i>
<i>both bottle--</i>

240
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:26,201
<i>Oh, my God, why am</i>
<i>I telling you this?</i>

241
00:09:26,203 --> 00:09:27,369
<i>Let's move on.</i>

242
00:09:27,371 --> 00:09:30,905
Okay, you know that old video
of me streaking?

243
00:09:30,907 --> 00:09:33,074
I watch it every day.

244
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:35,928
Well, I need you to take it down
off the Internet.

245
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,346
Like, right now.

246
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:39,080
There are two ways
that can happen.

247
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:41,216
One, you can give me
$4 million,

248
00:09:41,218 --> 00:09:44,436
or... you can help me
go to the bathroom,

249
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:45,938
because I... I can't...

250
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:49,808
Yeah, those are two
non-negotiable no's.

251
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:51,777
Well, I'm sorry we could not
do business together.

252
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,061
But if you'll excuse me,

253
00:09:53,063 --> 00:09:55,447
I'm in the middle of a game
of "Edward Forty Hands,"

254
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:57,532
and the competition is fierce.

255
00:09:57,534 --> 00:10:00,268
Who are you
playing with, anyway?

256
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,438
Just myself.

257
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,041
<i>Meanwhile, Barney continued</i>
<i>listing every lie</i>

258
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:07,292
<i>he'd ever told to get laid.</i>

259
00:10:07,294 --> 00:10:09,728
There's no time to explain
how I got bit there.

260
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,863
I just need someone
to suck the poison out.

261
00:10:11,865 --> 00:10:14,032
The surgeons gave me a new face,

262
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:15,050
honey.

263
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:16,685
Aren't you relieved I'm alive?

264
00:10:16,687 --> 00:10:19,421
<i>Me llamo David Beckham.</i>

265
00:10:19,423 --> 00:10:22,207
If I were
only casting <i>The White Swan</i>

266
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:23,508
the role would be yours.

267
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,711
No, I am a lesbian.

268
00:10:25,713 --> 00:10:28,614
This thing that I'm wearing
is just really lifelike.

269
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:30,349
Okay, let's skip ahead.

270
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:31,483
What's the worst one?

271
00:10:31,485 --> 00:10:32,768
The lowest of the low?

272
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,186
The creme de la creepy?

273
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:37,990
Uh... Oh, I once pulled
<i>The Soul Man.</i>

274
00:10:37,992 --> 00:10:41,326
There was this beautiful girl
who only dated black guys...

275
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:45,130
Barnell!
Ooh, I knew it!

276
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,334
I can't decide.

277
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:50,836
They're both awesome.

278
00:10:50,838 --> 00:10:53,639
If only architects had
two balls, right, Ted?

279
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:55,507
I got this.

280
00:10:55,509 --> 00:10:57,009
Ted, left or right?

281
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:58,326
Yes, yes, great idea.

282
00:10:58,328 --> 00:10:59,961
Let the fates decide, huh?

283
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:02,114
I will pick left.

284
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:03,298
Just call one of 'em.

285
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,299
Ugh!

286
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:05,634
Ted, deep in your heart,

287
00:11:05,636 --> 00:11:07,936
you know that you
kind of like one

288
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:08,804
more than the other.

289
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:10,305
Trust me-- take the other.

290
00:11:10,307 --> 00:11:13,308
Um, maybe I haven't
this is...

291
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,677
the Architects'
Ball, Robin.

292
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:16,778
It's a star-studded event.

293
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,013
Okay, name one celebrity
who's gonna be there.

294
00:11:19,015 --> 00:11:20,348
Uh... Lenny Kravitz.

295
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,800
Lenny Kravitz is gonna be there?

296
00:11:21,802 --> 00:11:23,235
Yeah.
He's there every year.

297
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:24,453
And that guy's a rock star.

298
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:27,706
You know, Ted,
I've been thinking--

299
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,876
it's too soon to narrow it down
between these two girls.

300
00:11:30,878 --> 00:11:31,993
Just take a friend.

301
00:11:31,995 --> 00:11:34,830
Like I... I don't know,
maybe, uh, a friend

302
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:37,999
who had a poster of
Lenny Kravitz on her wall,

303
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:40,719
and may or may not
have, perhaps,

304
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:43,655
dated that poster, on and off,
throughout high school.

305
00:11:44,724 --> 00:11:47,375
This pros and cons list
isn't cutting it.

306
00:11:48,978 --> 00:11:50,712
I need a color chart.

307
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:52,931
Color chart! Color chart!

308
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:56,334
<i>And, kids,</i>
<i>we all really chanted.</i>

309
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:57,352
Pete, please.

310
00:11:57,354 --> 00:11:59,154
I'm unemployed.

311
00:11:59,156 --> 00:12:00,439
I have a huge mortgage.

312
00:12:00,441 --> 00:12:01,940
I have a baby on the way.

313
00:12:01,942 --> 00:12:04,693
And now, I'm about
to lose a job I really need

314
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:06,578
because of a 15-year-old prank!

315
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,113
Ugh! Do you hear yourself?

316
00:12:08,115 --> 00:12:09,581
Beercules, what happened?

317
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,816
You're like a different person.

318
00:12:11,784 --> 00:12:13,668
The guy in that video
was awesome.

319
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,254
He had potential.

320
00:12:16,256 --> 00:12:18,540
He could have been president of
the frat one day.

321
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:20,208
There was no frat!

322
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,376
Now he's just a bummer.

323
00:12:21,378 --> 00:12:23,578
It's not like I want
to be a bummer.

324
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:26,098
I just... I have to be.

325
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,582
I'm gonna be a dad.

326
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:28,850
You'll have kids someday.

327
00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:29,968
You'll understand.

328
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:32,587
Dude, I have four kids.

329
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:35,757
Pete, please take
the video down.

330
00:12:36,776 --> 00:12:38,777
All right, Beercules,
I'll take the video down.

331
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:40,228
If...

332
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:43,315
you can best me in
a game of my own choosing.

333
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:44,566
Oh, no...

334
00:12:44,568 --> 00:12:47,035
And I select the beautiful game,

335
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:48,269
the sweet science...

336
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:50,071
Pete, please,
I'm so hungover...

337
00:12:50,073 --> 00:12:51,156
...the sport of kings...

338
00:12:51,158 --> 00:12:53,125
I don't want to play
"Edward Forty Hands."

339
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:54,275
I was gonna say darts--

340
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:57,078
but "Edward Forty
Hands" it is!

341
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,881
And that concludes all
the space-related lies.

342
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:02,584
Let's move on to
the world of sports.

343
00:13:02,586 --> 00:13:05,554
Oh, wait, sorry-- I just thought
of another space one.

344
00:13:05,556 --> 00:13:07,889
"I've been bitten
by a moon snake.

345
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:10,458
You need to suck all the
space poison out of my--"

346
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,144
Okay, Barney, uh,

347
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:13,678
I have to be at work
tomorrow at 8:00,

348
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,347
which means I have
just about enough time

349
00:13:15,349 --> 00:13:17,749
to sit in a shower for 11 hours,
hugging myself.

350
00:13:20,086 --> 00:13:21,236
So this was fun.

351
00:13:21,238 --> 00:13:22,454
Can I call you, or...?

352
00:13:22,456 --> 00:13:25,607
Barney, you're funny, handsome

353
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:27,275
and really quite clever.

354
00:13:27,277 --> 00:13:29,444
But you're also a sociopath.

355
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:31,346
Well, I count three pros
and one con, so...

356
00:13:31,348 --> 00:13:33,832
How do you still think
you have a chance with me?

357
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:36,168
Because you sat
here all night.

358
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,320
You could've left right
away, but you didn't.

359
00:13:39,288 --> 00:13:43,758
Look, Nora, all those lies--
that's the old me.

360
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,561
But I swear to you,
I am trying to change.

361
00:13:46,563 --> 00:13:50,465
You... make me want to change.

362
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:53,351
How do I know that's not a lie?

363
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:55,070
I'll prove it.

364
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:56,938
I will prove how serious I am.

365
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,674
I will not leave this diner

366
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:02,878
until I get
a second date with you.

367
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,197
Good-bye, Barney.

368
00:14:05,648 --> 00:14:07,032
I'm not kidding.

369
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:08,483
This is a 24-hour diner.

370
00:14:08,485 --> 00:14:12,120
I'll stay here forever,
if I have to-- and I will!

371
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:15,690
Just water for me. Thanks.

372
00:14:18,193 --> 00:14:20,996
Okay, so red indicates
level of attractiveness,

373
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:23,465
blue--
intellectual stimulation,

374
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,050
green-- emotional connection,

375
00:14:25,052 --> 00:14:27,702
yellow-- compatibility
of life goals,

376
00:14:27,704 --> 00:14:31,205
and purple-- whether or not
she reached for the check.

377
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,642
Well, it looks like
Jessica's ahead

378
00:14:33,644 --> 00:14:35,710
in the first
four categories.

379
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,415
Did not reach for the check...

380
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:44,052
Oh, this?

381
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:46,721
No big deal. This...

382
00:14:46,723 --> 00:14:48,356
This cost three
months rent,

383
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:50,025
and, uh, I've never
gotten to wear it,

384
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:52,861
because I bought it for that big
event that you invited me to,

385
00:14:52,863 --> 00:14:54,395
which then fell through.

386
00:14:54,397 --> 00:14:55,830
But, you know what?

387
00:14:55,832 --> 00:14:57,449
Don't feel guilty about that.

388
00:14:57,451 --> 00:14:58,416
What big event?

389
00:14:58,418 --> 00:14:59,567
That thing with your uncle.

390
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:01,353
His funeral?

391
00:15:02,088 --> 00:15:03,204
It didn't fall through,

392
00:15:03,206 --> 00:15:04,706
he miraculously
came out of a coma.

393
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,508
And I forgive you.

394
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,094
Now, can I please
meet Lenny Kravitz?

395
00:15:12,414 --> 00:15:13,882
I did it again!

396
00:15:13,884 --> 00:15:15,800
Aw, honey.

397
00:15:15,802 --> 00:15:17,085
You got drunk again.

398
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:19,721
I can't believe
I took the over.

399
00:15:19,723 --> 00:15:24,192
Just to be clear, "I did it
again" is not a reference...

400
00:15:24,194 --> 00:15:26,761
to my current state of
inebriation.

401
00:15:26,763 --> 00:15:28,930
What's it a reference to?

402
00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,899
My name is Marshall Eriksen.

403
00:15:30,901 --> 00:15:32,884
I'm 33 years old.

404
00:15:32,886 --> 00:15:37,956
And if my potential future
employer, Garrison Cootes,

405
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,441
is watching this...

406
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:43,128
bow down to Beercules!

407
00:15:50,086 --> 00:15:51,920
Well, that could
be anybody.

408
00:15:57,362 --> 00:15:58,694
Oh, goodness.

409
00:16:06,076 --> 00:16:07,985
Pete, this is Lily Aldrin.

410
00:16:07,986 --> 00:16:09,719
I'm gonna make this real simple:

411
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:11,571
You're gonna take down
that video of Marshall.

412
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:12,972
You know why?

413
00:16:12,974 --> 00:16:16,025
Because I'm friends with three
girls who dated you in college,

414
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:18,527
and girls
tell each other everything.

415
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:21,214
Every <i>tiny</i> detail.

416
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:22,532
Huh. So...

417
00:16:22,534 --> 00:16:27,887
tick-tock, Pete-- tick-tock goes
the little wee-wee clock.

418
00:16:28,756 --> 00:16:29,872
Pete's got a little wee-wee?

419
00:16:29,874 --> 00:16:31,591
No idea.
What's everyone getting?

420
00:16:31,593 --> 00:16:34,761
This was bound to
happen eventually.

421
00:16:34,763 --> 00:16:37,730
I've been trying so hard
to suppress, like,

422
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:39,382
my carefree idiot side,

423
00:16:39,384 --> 00:16:43,219
that it just rebelled
and came out swingin'!

424
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:44,387
It sure did.

425
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:46,773
Look at me! I'm a windmill!

426
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:49,943
Who am I kidding?
I'm not ready to be a dad.

427
00:16:49,945 --> 00:16:52,779
I thought that I was,
but it's, like...

428
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:55,915
my dad never did stuff
like that, you know?

429
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:57,400
So what if he did?

430
00:16:57,402 --> 00:16:59,285
You'd still love him.

431
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:02,922
And be honest-- wouldn't you
love to stumble onto a video

432
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:05,441
of him running down
the street naked, yelling,

433
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:07,176
"Hey, Marshall, look at me!

434
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:09,696
I got an icicle on my deal!"

435
00:17:13,935 --> 00:17:15,218
Oh! Hey, guys!

436
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,919
Ow! My neck!

437
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:19,389
Uh... oh! Hey!

438
00:17:19,391 --> 00:17:20,807
Look at that.

439
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:23,426
Barney, what are
you doing here?

440
00:17:23,428 --> 00:17:26,529
Oh, I told Nora I wouldn't leave
until she gave me a second date,

441
00:17:26,531 --> 00:17:27,814
and I mean it.

442
00:17:27,816 --> 00:17:29,265
I've already been here
nine hours.

443
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:32,035
I still need
another minute.

444
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:35,288
I mean... call me crazy, but

445
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,890
I'm gonna stay here until
I get that girl back.

446
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,796
That-- that's
what I want.

447
00:17:44,715 --> 00:17:46,299
The way Barney
feels about Nora--

448
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:47,950
I want that feeling again.

449
00:17:48,952 --> 00:17:50,837
I don't want to be choosing
between two girls,

450
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:55,641
I want to be... a complete
head-over-heels idiot for one.

451
00:17:55,643 --> 00:17:57,727
Yeah, the complete
head-over-heels idiot thing's

452
00:17:57,729 --> 00:17:59,896
pretty nice.

453
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:02,315
It's not bad.

454
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:05,101
Although, for the record--

455
00:18:05,103 --> 00:18:08,571
sweeping declaration!--

456
00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:13,493
I am never getting
drunk again.

457
00:18:14,412 --> 00:18:16,429
<i>And sure enough...</i>

458
00:18:16,431 --> 00:18:18,331
All hail Beercules!

459
00:18:19,718 --> 00:18:21,017
Yeah!

460
00:18:21,019 --> 00:18:23,703
<i>But, again,</i>
<i>I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

461
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:34,013
Hello.

462
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:36,165
Marshall! Garrison Cootes.

463
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,333
Yes, Mr. Cootes.

464
00:18:37,335 --> 00:18:38,651
Hi. How are you?

465
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:40,603
I just wanted to let you know,
we did the background check,

466
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:43,306
and that is
some disturbing streaking.

467
00:18:43,308 --> 00:18:45,108
Sir, th-th-the thing is, um...

468
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,176
The rainbow streaking
in this sample

469
00:18:47,178 --> 00:18:49,028
is definitely
from chemical runoff.

470
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,180
Oh, I...

471
00:18:51,182 --> 00:18:54,183
Bottom line-- we'd love to have
you on board.

472
00:18:54,185 --> 00:18:55,201
That is fantastic!

473
00:18:55,203 --> 00:18:57,353
Thank you, Mr. Cootes!

474
00:18:57,355 --> 00:18:58,354
Well, you're welcome.

475
00:18:58,356 --> 00:19:00,156
And-- oh, and when
you're at the office,

476
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:02,408
try to wear some clothes,
okay, Beercules?

477
00:19:04,746 --> 00:19:06,045
Wow! That's a big snake.

478
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:07,213
Oh, there's
a snake in the swamp?

479
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:08,664
No, I'm talking about
your penis.

480
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:09,982
See you tomorrow.

481
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:12,418
I got the job.

482
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,869
Yay!

483
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:16,305
And I think that my boss
already sexually harassed me.

484
00:19:16,307 --> 00:19:18,891
But he saw the video
and he doesn't care!

485
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:21,811
See that? Maybe Beercules
isn't so bad after all.

486
00:19:21,813 --> 00:19:22,762
Yeah.

487
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:25,214
Hello?

488
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:27,733
Hey, Marshall,
my name is Pete Durkenson.

489
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:29,152
We went to Wesleyan together.

490
00:19:29,154 --> 00:19:30,403
Yeah, no, I know.

491
00:19:30,405 --> 00:19:32,605
Pete, we... we just
hung out yesterday.

492
00:19:32,607 --> 00:19:34,824
All right, now Lily's message
makes a little more sense.

493
00:19:34,826 --> 00:19:37,360
Listen, don't worry, bro,
I'm gonna take down the video.

494
00:19:37,362 --> 00:19:38,578
You know what?

495
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,062
Leave it up.

496
00:19:40,064 --> 00:19:41,831
Whatever you say, Beercules.

497
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:46,702
Scalpel.

498
00:19:46,704 --> 00:19:48,921
You know what?
This is good.

499
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:51,340
I want our kid to see
every side of who I am.

500
00:19:51,342 --> 00:19:52,592
Yeah.

501
00:19:52,594 --> 00:19:54,076
Even the side that runs through

502
00:19:54,078 --> 00:19:56,195
the East Village hangin' brain.

503
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:59,132
I'm gonna call Pete back.

504
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:00,550
That's a good idea.

505
00:20:00,552 --> 00:20:03,752
<i>That evening, I took</i>

Mm. My pleasure.

Yeah, yeah.
Where's Lenny Kravitz?

511
00:20:11,262 --> 00:20:12,928
Right there.

512
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:16,782
Leonard Kravitz,
world-renowned architect.

513
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:19,035
Guy's a rock star.

514
00:20:19,037 --> 00:20:20,653
He's gonna be
giving his famous

00:20:20,655 --> 00:20:22,038
90-minute lecture
on crossbeams.

516
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,539
Well, great.

517
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,825
I'm gonna go find one
and hang myself from it.

518
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:27,243
Okay.
