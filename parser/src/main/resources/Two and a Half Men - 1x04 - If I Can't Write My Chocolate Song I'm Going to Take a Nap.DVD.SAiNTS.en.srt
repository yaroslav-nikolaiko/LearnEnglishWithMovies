1
00:00:03,653 --> 00:00:06,986
Charlie? Honey, wake up.

2
00:00:09,192 --> 00:00:11,717
- Good morning.
- You lied to me, Charlie.

3
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:16,327
You said it was
just going to be the two of us.

4
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,801
I didn't lie, Berta. Things change.

5
00:00:20,003 --> 00:00:21,800
Goodbye, Charlie.

6
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:24,965
Don't leave me, Berta.

7
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:27,306
I love you.

8
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,243
- Can't we talk about this?
- Sorry. I do single men only.

9
00:00:30,346 --> 00:00:33,008
I'm in, I'm out, there are no complications.

10
00:00:34,317 --> 00:00:35,648
But I am single.

11
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,177
Berta? I hate to bring this up again,
but you just...

12
00:00:39,255 --> 00:00:42,691
You cannot put the peanut butter
in the refrigerator. It gets hard.

13
00:00:43,993 --> 00:00:46,860
And, on a related subject,
the peanut-butter stains

14
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,763
on Jake's shirts
really require an enzyme presoak.

15
00:00:50,734 --> 00:00:53,328
I hope you two will be
very happy together.

16
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:56,330
But who's going to take care of me?

17
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:58,465
Who's going to do the laundry,
the shopping,

18
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:02,307
- and the cleaning and all the other stuff?
- Ask the Scrubbing Bubble there.

19
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,843
Uncle Charlie, why is Berta leaving?

20
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:10,348
Why? It doesn't matter, Jake.

21
00:01:11,054 --> 00:01:13,318
What matters is she's gone.

22
00:01:15,058 --> 00:01:16,923
And we're all going to die.

23
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:30,062
She left before she made the coffee.

24
00:01:32,142 --> 00:01:34,133
So? We'll make our own coffee.

25
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:35,905
How?

26
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:47,545
So, now we just wait?

27
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:49,785
Yes. It takes a couple of minutes.

28
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:55,160
Alan, this goes beyond coffee.

29
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:58,098
Berta's been with me forever.
She does everything.

30
00:01:58,168 --> 00:02:00,568
She's like a wife that leaves
before you wake up,

31
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:03,162
and doesn't mind if you sleep around.

32
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,173
Is that the coffee?

33
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:08,309
It's my peanut butter. I made it soft.

34
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,581
I've been figuring out a way to repay you
for letting me and Jake stay here.

35
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,778
- Why don't I take over the housework?
- Berta did the shopping, too.

36
00:02:16,853 --> 00:02:19,014
- I can do that.
- She did my laundry.

37
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:20,987
In her way, yes.

38
00:02:22,258 --> 00:02:24,658
But I can handle that, too. And look,

39
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:28,025
I even made your coffee.

40
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:29,624
Thank you.

41
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:33,927
No.

42
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:37,172
Not as good as Berta's.

43
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:39,867
It's her coffee. I just pressed the button.

44
00:02:41,177 --> 00:02:44,977
Berta's tasted, I don't know, Christmassy.

45
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:47,908
What does that mean, "Christmassy?"

46
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,980
It means "like Christmas. "

47
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,021
Now, you got to work with me, Charlie.

48
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:55,920
I mean, nutmeg, cinnamon,
powdered reindeer?

49
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:58,653
I don't know.
It's just that when you drank it,

50
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,594
it felt like Christmas morning,
and anything was possible.

51
00:03:02,498 --> 00:03:05,990
Sweet'N Low? Half & Half? Mocha Mix?

52
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,430
Forget it. I'll just read my paper.

53
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:12,606
Where's my paper?

54
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:15,337
I don't know.
You might try looking by the front door.

55
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,777
No, it's usually right here, on the table.

56
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:22,216
Okay, so before you got up, Berta started
the coffee and got you your paper?

57
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,287
I don't know the mechanics of it,
but, yeah.

58
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:27,179
I'll go get it.

59
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:32,493
He's not off to a very good start.

60
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,061
Want a glass of peanut butter?

61
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,709
- Alan?
- Yeah?

62
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,512
I can see you.

63
00:04:00,089 --> 00:04:01,886
And I can see you, too.

64
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:07,929
No. I mean, Berta never cleaned
when I was in the room.

65
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:09,862
She was like invisible.

66
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:12,595
I'm sorry. I'll try to be more transparent.

67
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:14,736
Appreciate it.

68
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,072
Oh, no.

69
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:24,740
I see you.

70
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,474
Give me a break.

71
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:30,242
Not you. That girl that's been stalking me.

72
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,982
Rose?

73
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,248
There you are.

74
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:38,550
What are you doing
sneaking up on me like that?

75
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,720
Rose, honey,

76
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:45,223
we spent one night together,
and it was very nice, but...

77
00:04:45,335 --> 00:04:47,326
What is your favorite part?

78
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:52,505
Gee, I'd have to say, finding out you live
just two doors down.

79
00:04:53,609 --> 00:04:57,375
Sometimes, it's all I can do not to chew
through that house in the middle.

80
00:04:58,614 --> 00:04:59,774
Yeah.

81
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,283
But see, I'm not looking for
a relationship right now.

82
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:07,846
So, maybe you should find someone
who can give you the attention you want.

83
00:05:08,424 --> 00:05:10,085
Need, deserve,

84
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,058
require.

85
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:16,356
Are you saying we should see
other people?

86
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:17,956
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

87
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,969
You have so much love to give,
and somewhere out there is a guy who

88
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:24,204
can take it.

89
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:28,335
- Well, there is this one guy...
- He sounds perfect.

90
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:32,948
His name is Andy.
He works at Jamba Juice.

91
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:37,179
He always gives me a free wheatgrass
shooter and chuckles when I gag.

92
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,752
Then ask him out.

93
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:42,086
That seems kind of forward,
don't you think?

94
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:44,853
No, come on,
women ask guys out all the time.

95
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:47,452
What they don't do
is handcuff themselves

96
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:50,691
to the refrigerator,
when he says it's time to go home.

97
00:05:51,901 --> 00:05:54,768
That's where you and I
went off the track, isn't it?

98
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,440
I'm the past. Andy's the future.

99
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:02,876
Bye-bye now. Good luck,

100
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:05,036
Andy.

101
00:06:21,264 --> 00:06:22,595
Alan?

102
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,268
- What did you do to my piano?
- Nothing. I just dusted.

103
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:30,396
Yes, well, I'm sitting here trying
to write a jingle about a chocolate bar

104
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,839
and my piano smells like lemons.

105
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:36,341
Gee, I'm sorry, Charlie.
But they don't make chocolate Pledge.

106
00:06:37,447 --> 00:06:39,472
Maybe I'm not making myself clear.

107
00:06:39,582 --> 00:06:42,847
The rest of the house can smell like
any fruit you want.

108
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,854
But my piano needs to smell...

109
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,190
- Piano-y.
- There you go.

110
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,450
Fine. I'll get an unscented polish.

111
00:06:52,762 --> 00:06:55,424
That's not going to help me now, is it?

112
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,298
Nope.

113
00:06:58,401 --> 00:07:02,462
You know what? You are a child.
You're a big, high-maintenance child.

114
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:04,596
I am not a child.

115
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,334
Where you going?

116
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:09,900
If I can't write my chocolate song,
I'm going to take a nap.

117
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,518
Charlie, you asleep?

118
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:23,952
I'm doing a load of whites.

119
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:13,373
Jeez!

120
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:15,806
- Charlie?
- What?

121
00:08:15,878 --> 00:08:17,812
You kicked me in your sleep.

122
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,711
Who said I was asleep?

123
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:22,544
I can't do this anymore.
You are impossible.

124
00:08:22,652 --> 00:08:25,314
Don't blame me. I tried to make it work.

125
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:27,549
Excuse me? Berta quit at 9:00.

126
00:08:27,657 --> 00:08:30,683
It's now 2:30. When did you try?
Where was the trying?

127
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,290
You're the one who made Berta quit.

128
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:34,920
I didn't make her quit.

129
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:37,124
I simply raised the bar
of quality housework

130
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,532
and she insisted on limboing under it.

131
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:42,134
But since you obviously
can't live without her,

132
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:45,504
you big baby,
I will go apologize and get her back.

133
00:08:45,575 --> 00:08:47,338
- Great.
- So, where does she live?

134
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:52,571
I don't know.

135
00:08:53,182 --> 00:08:55,241
Okay. What's her last name?

136
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:01,720
Your entire life depends on this woman
and you know nothing about her.

137
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:03,086
Wait.

138
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:05,553
She took a bus.

139
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:08,558
I stand corrected.

140
00:09:10,032 --> 00:09:13,433
After she works here in the morning,
she cleans some rock star's house.

141
00:09:13,536 --> 00:09:15,697
Okay, what rock star? Where?

142
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:20,432
Steven Tyler from Aerosmith.
4456 Malibu Canyon Road.

143
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:24,178
Thank you.

144
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:29,244
Now listen, Judith is coming by at 5:00 to
pick up Jake for dinner with her parents.

145
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,615
Now I should be back by then.

146
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:33,086
But you need to make sure
he's dressed and ready to go.

147
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:35,453
- No problem.
- No, it's a problem, Charlie.

148
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:37,856
I'm trying desperately
to reconcile with my wife,

149
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:39,519
so I don't want to tick her off.

150
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:42,257
So, you telling me, "It's no problem,"
does not reassure me.

151
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:45,425
Here. Take my sock.
I want to show you a trick.

152
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:51,867
I'll go get Berta.
You make sure Jake is ready.

153
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:56,144
- Hi.
- Hello.

154
00:09:56,245 --> 00:09:59,237
There are security cameras out front,
so come up from the back,

155
00:09:59,315 --> 00:10:02,648
and bring some dog treats,
in case the rottweilers are out.

156
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:07,048
Again, thank you.

157
00:10:10,993 --> 00:10:13,461
I asked Andy out, and he said yes.

158
00:10:13,896 --> 00:10:17,332
- Andy?
- That guy you told me to ask out.

159
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,562
I just don't know what to wear.

160
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:22,468
I love this one,
but it still smells like pepper spray.

161
00:10:25,308 --> 00:10:27,139
Where are you going?

162
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,771
To roll around naked on your bed.

163
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:34,773
I'm just kidding.
I'm going to try on the dress, silly.

164
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,477
But...

165
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,653
- Is that lady your girlfriend?
- No, she's just...

166
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:43,287
It's complicated.

167
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:50,328
- What the hell happened to you?
- You know what else is complicated?

168
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,798
Fractions.

169
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:54,834
You got grease all over you.

170
00:10:55,538 --> 00:10:57,403
It's in your hair, man.

171
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,232
Yes. My bike chain broke. Can you fix it?

172
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:04,309
Kid, I'm a piano player. What do you think?

173
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:08,540
Look, your mom's going to be here soon
to take you to dinner.

174
00:11:08,651 --> 00:11:09,913
I know.

175
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:12,419
- So, how about a shower?
- No, thank you.

176
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:15,053
That wasn't a question.

177
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,394
Sorry, pal, but you need a shower.

178
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:25,434
But my bike's still broken.
I think you made it worse.

179
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:28,401
What are you talking about?
Now you got a unicycle.

180
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:30,098
Get in the shower.

181
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:36,443
- I'm so worried he's not going to like me.
- He's going to love you, Rose.

182
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:39,878
Just go out, have a great time,
and don't come on too strong.

183
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,281
Me, too strong? What do you mean?

184
00:11:43,252 --> 00:11:45,243
Okay, speaking from my own experience,

185
00:11:45,321 --> 00:11:48,347
there's nothing wrong with asking a guy
for a blood test,

186
00:11:48,424 --> 00:11:51,552
but trying to take the blood yourself
is a little strong.

187
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,555
- I see.
- Where you going now?

188
00:11:55,231 --> 00:11:58,223
You got me thinking
this dress comes on too strong.

189
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,894
So, I'm going to put on something
a little less...

190
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,835
And a little more...

191
00:12:07,276 --> 00:12:09,972
Jake, why aren't you in the shower?

192
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:12,712
Oh, yeah.

193
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,488
Hi, Berta. It's me, the Scrubbing Bubble.

194
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,698
I came to apologize.

195
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,997
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

196
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,466
Come on, can't we put aside
our petty differences

197
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:44,036
and find a way to work together
out of a mutual love for Charlie?

198
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:46,874
Yeah, that's why I do this. For love.

199
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:51,381
The thing is, I'm going through
a really tough time right now.

200
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:54,752
My marriage is collapsing,
my business is slow.

201
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,189
My little boy is being dragged
back and forth

202
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:59,386
from his mother's house to Malibu.

203
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:02,794
My alcoholic husband ran off
with my daughter's parole officer,

204
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,766
and I clean rich peoples' toilets for a living.

205
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:08,626
Okay, let's not make this a competition.

206
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,534
Jake, you've been in there for a while.
How's it going?

207
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:17,909
Good.

208
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:27,986
What are you doing?

209
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,820
Washing my bike chain. It's real dirty.

210
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:32,583
Forget about the chain.

211
00:13:32,661 --> 00:13:35,494
You got to take a shower
before your mother gets here.

212
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:45,103
We're going to need a new chain.

213
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:52,807
Hello, Charlie's house. May I help you?

214
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,941
Hi, Alan, it's Rose. I got in. How'd you do?

215
00:13:56,952 --> 00:13:58,613
Here he is.

216
00:13:58,687 --> 00:14:01,019
- It's your brother.
- Thank you.

217
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:08,026
How's it going? Did you talk to Berta?

218
00:14:08,464 --> 00:14:10,125
Yes, I'm here with her now.

219
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:12,292
- Is Jake ready?
- Yes.

220
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:15,030
We're just applying the finishing touches.

221
00:14:17,706 --> 00:14:20,971
- What about Berta?
- The same. Finishing touches.

222
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:23,170
She's really a delight.

223
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:29,412
Just make sure Jake is ready
when Judith gets there.

224
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:32,812
Relax. Everything's under control.
I got to go.

225
00:14:34,657 --> 00:14:37,421
- So, you like this dress better?
- Hang on, Rose.

226
00:14:37,526 --> 00:14:39,858
The kid's running around the deck
in his underwear.

227
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:42,864
Sure. But when I do it, you just ignore me.

228
00:14:43,532 --> 00:14:46,433
- Jake, what are you doing?
- Air drying.

229
00:14:46,735 --> 00:14:49,226
You still have grease in your hair.
Didn't you wash it?

230
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:51,363
You didn't say to wash my hair.

231
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:54,736
- Wash your hair.
- Okay.

232
00:14:57,446 --> 00:14:59,414
You didn't tell him to rinse.

233
00:15:00,382 --> 00:15:02,407
Good, that's good. Thank you.

234
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:04,708
Jake, rinse!

235
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:07,716
All right, so you won't come back.

236
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,918
Will you at least tell me how you made
the damn coffee Christmassy?

237
00:15:11,026 --> 00:15:12,084
Christmassy?

238
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,391
Yeah, Charlie said
your coffee tastes Christmassy.

239
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:17,057
- Cinnamon.
- I said cinnamon.

240
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:21,927
Lower back? You do a lot of lifting?

241
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:26,533
Of course you do.
You're a maid, and I'm an ass.

242
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:28,436
- I'm a housekeeper.
- Of course.

243
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,411
- And you're an ass.
- Yes.

244
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:34,515
Why don't you sit down,
let me take a look at it?

245
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:36,778
- What?
- I'm a chiropractor.

246
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,150
Okay. But no funny business.

247
00:15:42,391 --> 00:15:43,915
Not to worry.

248
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:50,262
Looks like you washed
your hair instead of mine.

249
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:54,962
I'm not in the mood, Jake.

250
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:58,132
These clothes look stupid.

251
00:15:58,273 --> 00:16:00,366
You're 10. No one cares.

252
00:16:01,744 --> 00:16:04,212
- You're choking me.
- Trust me.

253
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:06,837
You'll know when I'm choking you.

254
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:10,216
I think my socks are on the wrong feet.

255
00:16:10,452 --> 00:16:12,943
Jake, dude, I'm right on the edge.

256
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,149
Don't push me.

257
00:16:19,194 --> 00:16:21,219
I can't do this on someone else.

258
00:16:21,497 --> 00:16:23,897
- Charlie?
- You look great, Rose.

259
00:16:25,668 --> 00:16:28,193
I don't think I can go through with this.

260
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,262
What? No. Sure you can.

261
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:35,173
- No, I'm going to call Andy and cancel.
- No, you're not. Now listen to me.

262
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,270
You're a wonderful woman.
And this guy, Andy, is going to love you.

263
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,281
Thanks, but you're saying that
just to get me out of your hair.

264
00:16:41,383 --> 00:16:43,010
No, not just.

265
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:49,383
- Now go out and have a great time.
- But...

266
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:53,728
No goodbyes.
Just turn around and walk away.

267
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,863
Okay.

268
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,328
Goodbye.

269
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,730
Goodbye, Rose.

270
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:12,741
- What happened?
- I have to go to the bathroom.

271
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:15,176
Why did you take your clothes off?

272
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,979
Sometimes, I miss.

273
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:22,245
Okay. That's it. I give up.

274
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:25,526
You are a child, Jake.

275
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:30,428
Dress, don't dress. Wash, don't wash.

276
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:32,760
I don't care. You're on your own.

277
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,267
What?

278
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:43,209
God, that feels so good.

279
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:47,207
Berta, I can't find my...

280
00:17:50,018 --> 00:17:52,782
Berta, if you're going to do a guy
in the laundry room,

281
00:17:52,855 --> 00:17:55,380
put a scarf on the doorknob or something.

282
00:17:57,726 --> 00:17:59,318
I'm a big fan.

283
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:05,825
Is Jake ready?

284
00:18:06,368 --> 00:18:07,892
Where's Jake?

285
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,131
I don't know.

286
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:13,504
You don't know?
My wife just pulled in behind me.

287
00:18:13,575 --> 00:18:16,908
- You said you'd have him ready.
- It can't be done.

288
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,711
What do you mean, it can't be done?

289
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,340
I'm not strong enough.

290
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:26,252
His will is greater than mine.

291
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,216
I'm just going to get drunk
and stay out of his way.

292
00:18:34,263 --> 00:18:37,255
Please tell me he's ready.
My parents are driving me nuts.

293
00:18:37,432 --> 00:18:39,024
Well...

294
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,733
Hi, Mom.

295
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,099
Don't you look handsome?

296
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:47,707
- Uncle Charlie took my tie.
- You don't need a tie.

297
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:51,974
Grow up, Charlie.

298
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,942
Bye.

299
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:56,912
- I thought you said he beat you?
- He did.

300
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:00,812
Now he's just screwing with me.

301
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,386
What happened with Berta?

302
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,293
It wasn't easy, but I did it.

303
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:12,097
She won't do my laundry,
or get my groceries,

304
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:15,395
and I have to give her
a lower back adjustment twice a week.

305
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:18,603
And Steven Tyler thinks I'm doing her.

306
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:25,477
- But she is coming back?
- Yes, Charlie, she is coming back.

307
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:29,148
Right on.

308
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:34,380
Are you crying?

309
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:40,151
It's been a very emotional day.

310
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:46,163
Here you go, buddy. Drink your vodka.

311
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,686
You look great, Rose, I swear.

312
00:20:09,057 --> 00:20:10,615
He stood me up.

313
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:14,226
What? After we spent all day
getting ready?

314
00:20:17,432 --> 00:20:20,458
- I don't know what I did wrong.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

315
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:23,868
- Then why did he stand me up?
- Because he's an idiot.

316
00:20:23,939 --> 00:20:27,739
He doesn't get
what a truly rare person you are.

317
00:20:28,243 --> 00:20:29,574
Thanks.

318
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,773
I wish Randy could see what you see.

319
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:36,281
Forget about him. Come on,
I'm going to take you to dinner.

320
00:20:36,351 --> 00:20:38,751
- Really?
- Yeah, sure, why not?

321
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:49,620
I thought you said his name was Andy.

322
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,325
What did I say?

323
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,902
- You said Randy.
- No, I didn't.

324
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,973
Andy's a real guy. I didn't make him up.

325
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,333
I love your little tie.

326
00:21:31,406 --> 00:21:32,600
English
