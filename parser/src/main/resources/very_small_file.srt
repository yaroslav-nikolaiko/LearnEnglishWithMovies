00:00:01,923 --> 00:00:05,196
I want you to tell me
the truth about Joffrey.

2
00:00:05,522 --> 00:00:06,872
He's a monster.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,448
With the Tyrells beside us, no one
will think of rebelling for another century.

00:13:57,768 --> 00:14:01,938
<i>— ♪ — That Lord of Castamere — ♪ —</i>

00:00:11,568 --> 00:00:13,635
Ser Dontos of House Hollard.

7
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:15,770
Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos
celebrate my name day.

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,640
It would be bad luck to kill a man
on your name day.

9
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,160
You'll be my new fool!

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,432
Thank you, Your Grace.

11
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:23,976
Do you know
what it takes to unite 19 clans?

12
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,597
I told them we were all going to die
