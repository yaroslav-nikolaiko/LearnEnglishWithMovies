1
00:00:01,117 --> 00:00:03,017
Let's see, what else?

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:06,180
Okay. Here's one of the first things
your uncle Charlie wrote.

3
00:00:07,157 --> 00:00:10,923
<i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>

4
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:17,292
What do you think?

5
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:19,563
Must have been before my time.

6
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:24,664
Okay, we're done here.

7
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:30,138
Don't put your juice box on the piano,
it leaves a ring.

8
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,478
How could a box leave a ring?

9
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:35,617
Got to run to the grocery store.

10
00:00:35,685 --> 00:00:37,812
I'm gonna need somebody
to fold these clothes.

11
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:39,445
I don't know if the grocery store

12
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:41,683
is the first place I'd go for that,
but good luck.

13
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:46,190
Remember, you're being punished.
So, no TV, no computer, no GameBoy.

14
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,957
I need you to be my eyes and ears.

15
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:50,591
Okay, but you have to be
my liver and prostate.

16
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:54,866
Whoa, whose is this?

17
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:59,031
Charlie, you want to field that one?

18
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:03,101
No problem. Jake, sometimes when you
have a casual sexual relationship...

19
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:04,771
All right!

20
00:01:06,683 --> 00:01:10,210
Jake, we take in strangers' laundry
because we're poor.

21
00:01:11,788 --> 00:01:14,518
I'll be back in an hour.
Start folding. No TV.

22
00:01:19,028 --> 00:01:20,393
What'd you get busted for?

23
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,124
I painted my room at Mom's house.

24
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,666
- What's wrong with that?
- I'm 10 years old.

25
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:31,335
- How about a little sock golf?
- What's that?

26
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,873
Okay, here's how it works.

27
00:01:33,977 --> 00:01:36,207
The living room is a dogleg par four.

28
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:40,975
That means you have to get your sock
into the kitchen sink

29
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,075
- in four strokes or less.
- Okay.

30
00:01:43,486 --> 00:01:45,215
We'll play for a quarter a hole.

31
00:01:46,723 --> 00:01:48,020
Your handicap's obvious.

32
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:50,924
You're short, and you've never
heard of the Ninja Turtles.

33
00:01:51,294 --> 00:01:53,262
All right, keep your knees bent.

34
00:01:53,763 --> 00:01:56,095
Your arm straight and swing easy.

35
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,767
Oh, man, I'm being hustled.

36
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,867
- We can play for less if you want.
- Don't get cocky.

37
00:02:07,443 --> 00:02:09,035
There's 17 more holes.

38
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:21,056
The 18th hole, all square.

39
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:25,185
The defending champion looks
to have an easy tap-in for a birdie

40
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:28,829
as the gallery waits breathlessly
for the rookie to respond.

41
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:31,296
Would you please stop talking?

42
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:35,937
Tempers flare as the pressure mounts.

43
00:02:41,477 --> 00:02:43,741
- Yeah.
- It's unbelievable.

44
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:45,337
An eagle on the 18th.

45
00:02:45,448 --> 00:02:48,349
This has never happened before
in the history of sock golf!

46
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:49,782
A little help here?

47
00:02:49,853 --> 00:02:52,845
Fans are coming out of the gallery
with sacks of groceries

48
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,186
- for the young phenom.
- What's going on?

49
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,222
I won. I beat Uncle Charlie.

50
00:02:57,293 --> 00:02:59,887
Excuse me, didn't I ask you
to fold the laundry?

51
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:02,431
Laundry? Are you barking mad?

52
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:05,865
The child just won the coveted
Palmolive Cup.

53
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:09,469
I won. You lose.

54
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,672
When I ask Jake to do something,

55
00:03:12,742 --> 00:03:14,642
I need you to help me
make sure he does it.

56
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,770
I'm trying to teach him responsibility.

57
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,180
This sock is soaking wet.

58
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:22,945
Yeah, I chipped into the water hazard
on the ninth and the lid was open.

59
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,683
- So, this is toilet water?
- At least.

60
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:37,598
All right.
I put Jake to bed, I folded the laundry,

61
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,134
I put the groceries away...

62
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:41,363
The guilt thing doesn't work on me, Alan.

63
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:44,606
Yeah, well, it's all I got.
I'll be back in a little while.

64
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:48,268
- Where you going?
- I have to bring the garbage cans back in.

65
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:50,001
Today wasn't garbage day.

66
00:03:50,213 --> 00:03:53,273
- No, not here. At Judith's.
- At Judith's?

67
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:56,951
Alan, your wife threw you out.

68
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,352
Yeah, that doesn't mean
she doesn't need me.

69
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:01,083
Yeah, it kind of does.

70
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:06,627
Look, we're still married,
it's still my house,

71
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:08,960
and she still counts on me
to do a few chores.

72
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:12,524
It's good. It leaves the door open for,
you know, reconciliation.

73
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:14,398
I see.

74
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:18,470
So, how do you lift those garbage cans
without a spine?

75
00:04:23,713 --> 00:04:25,078
They're on wheels.

76
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,082
What are you watching?

77
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,852
I'm watching a movie,

78
00:04:38,928 --> 00:04:41,328
and you're not supposed
to be watching anything.

79
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:42,762
Oh, yeah.

80
00:04:43,132 --> 00:04:46,363
- Is that guy a good guy or a bad guy?
- Good guy.

81
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,331
And you're not supposed
to be watching TV.

82
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:50,833
I know.

83
00:04:54,844 --> 00:04:57,312
- Is that his girlfriend?
- Ex-girlfriend.

84
00:04:58,014 --> 00:04:59,675
But he still loves her, right?

85
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:02,376
I'm not going to walk you
through the whole movie.

86
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:04,983
I think so.

87
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:08,783
- Go to bed, Jake.
- Okay.

88
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:13,821
Who's that guy?

89
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,625
That's the guy he was in jail with

90
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:17,563
and told him
where the money was hidden.

91
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,066
Right.

92
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:23,305
- You're being punished. No TV.
- I know.

93
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:34,043
What the hell is going on?

94
00:05:35,985 --> 00:05:37,680
- Jake?
- Goodnight.

95
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,649
Hey, I'm watching that.

96
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:45,956
What part of "no TV"
didn't you understand?

97
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,826
I'm allowed to watch TV.

98
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:49,392
I mean Jake.

99
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:52,957
I said, "No TV." He said, "Okay. "
I said, "Go to bed. " He said, "Okay. "

100
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:55,800
- What'd you want from me?
- He's taking advantage of you

101
00:05:55,872 --> 00:05:57,533
because he knows
you won't follow through.

102
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,768
He obviously knows me
better than you do.

103
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,645
If this is gonna work out
with Jake living here part-time,

104
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:06,375
you have to be an adult.
You have to impose discipline.

105
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,610
Yeah, fine, whatever.
Give me back the remote.

106
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:11,243
No. You're not listening to me.
You need to be firm.

107
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,719
Okay.

108
00:06:13,723 --> 00:06:16,453
- Go to your room.
- Yes, like that.

109
00:06:16,826 --> 00:06:19,818
I mean it. Give me the remote
and go to your room.

110
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:21,226
That's very funny.

111
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,660
I'm serious. Get out of here,
or I will kick your ass.

112
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,343
Oh, man.

113
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,187
Shoo.

114
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:05,171
Jake.

115
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,601
It was on when I came in.

116
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:13,141
Yeah, right.

117
00:07:13,616 --> 00:07:16,483
What did I tell you about leaving
juice boxes on my piano?

118
00:07:16,719 --> 00:07:18,152
How do you know it's mine?

119
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:24,785
Come on, who else around here drinks
"Transylvania Goofy Juice"?

120
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:27,121
Good point.

121
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,164
And another thing. Were you on the deck
feeding the seagulls again?

122
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:33,702
Sorry, I forgot.

123
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:38,002
Okay. We need to talk.

124
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:41,167
Love you, Uncle Charlie.

125
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:45,574
Look, we don't feed the seagulls
because you can't get rid of them.

126
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:47,546
We don't leave
the doors and windows open,

127
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:50,484
because we get all kinds of bugs
and crap flying in the house.

128
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,953
- Okay.
- No. Don't just say "okay. "

129
00:07:53,022 --> 00:07:55,513
This is not the grownup
telling the kid what to do.

130
00:07:55,591 --> 00:07:58,116
This is just two guys agreeing
how to live together.

131
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,058
- Are we cool?
- Yeah. Cool.

132
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,362
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

133
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,599
- Was he watching TV?
- No.

134
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:11,863
Jake, I have to run a quick errand.

135
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:15,377
Why don't you wash and dress?
When I get back, we'll do something fun.

136
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:17,036
- Can we watch TV?
- Go.

137
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,815
Where are you off to?

138
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:24,809
The grocery store.

139
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,751
- You're going to Judith's, aren't you?
- No.

140
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,392
Then where are you going?

141
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:39,732
Judith's.

142
00:08:41,137 --> 00:08:42,764
- Alan.
- I have to.

143
00:08:42,838 --> 00:08:46,171
The timer on the sprinkler system
is broken,

144
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,972
and the flower beds are getting flooded,
and I love her and I want her back.

145
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:52,810
Buddy, I feel for you.

146
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:56,112
- Thank you.
- Unfortunately, the feeling is nausea.

147
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:00,745
Great. I'll see you later.

148
00:09:00,923 --> 00:09:03,790
Alan, you've been making
the same mistake your whole life.

149
00:09:03,859 --> 00:09:07,351
Being the good boy, fixing everything
so everybody would love you.

150
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,794
It didn't work with Mom.

151
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:11,731
It didn't work with either of the women
you went out with.

152
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,299
And it's not gonna work with your wife.

153
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,330
You know nothing about commitment
and responsibility to a relationship.

154
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,469
Granted. But I do know
when a woman's using me.

155
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:24,679
And by that I mean not in a fun way.

156
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:28,379
Well, you can rest easy,
because no one is using me.

157
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:34,988
And did you mean that I only dated
two women including Judith?

158
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:38,758
Because if you did,
I have two words for you.

159
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:41,996
Maxine Chernakoff.

160
00:09:55,778 --> 00:09:59,077
- Did you fix it?
- Not quite.

161
00:09:59,148 --> 00:10:01,139
It doesn't seem like
you're changing anything.

162
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,845
No? Well, sometimes change happens,
Judith, and you can't see it.

163
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:09,216
Okay. Fine. When you're done fixing this,

164
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:11,783
would you come and take a look
at the garbage disposal?

165
00:10:11,894 --> 00:10:13,327
- Sure.
- Thank you.

166
00:10:14,897 --> 00:10:16,262
Wait, no.

167
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,563
What?

168
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:22,970
No, I won't come inside
and look at the garbage disposal.

169
00:10:23,606 --> 00:10:25,005
Why not?

170
00:10:27,476 --> 00:10:30,570
I know when I'm being used, Judith,
and not in a fun way.

171
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,013
What are you talking about?

172
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:35,743
Who are we kidding? The marriage is over.

173
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:39,252
You're just afraid to move on,
so, you keep dragging me over here,

174
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:41,620
and I'm afraid to move on,
so I keep coming.

175
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,556
Goodbye, Judith. You're free.

176
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,491
I hope you find
whatever it is you're looking for.

177
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:08,649
- What you got there?
- Just a little bread.

178
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,315
Please tell me you're not feeding
the seagulls again.

179
00:11:14,857 --> 00:11:16,051
Okay.

180
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,523
Man, did you let another one of those
big flappy bastards in the house?

181
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:24,992
You have to put $1 in the swear jar,
you said "bastards. "

182
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:26,728
Smart, poke the bear.

183
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,197
I'm telling you, Jake, this is the last...

184
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,043
Yikes!

185
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,645
I'm really sorry, Uncle Charlie.

186
00:11:42,752 --> 00:11:44,720
I don't want to talk to you right now.

187
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,881
Hello, do you have a department
of animal control or bird abatement?

188
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:52,722
I have a seagull problem.

189
00:11:53,729 --> 00:11:55,128
Seagull.

190
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,122
Thank you, I'll hold.

191
00:11:58,234 --> 00:12:00,065
I didn't know there'd be so many.

192
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:04,305
I told you, don't feed the damn things.
I told you, don't leave the windows open.

193
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:06,170
Yeah, hi, who's this?

194
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,633
Phyllis Siegal.

195
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:21,047
No, Phyllis, I wanted to talk to somebody
about seagulls.

196
00:12:21,957 --> 00:12:23,982
I got a flock of seagulls in my house.

197
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:27,625
No, I don't know
whatever happened to them.

198
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:30,055
I'm really sorry.

199
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:32,857
We had an agreement, Jake,
and you broke it.

200
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:36,802
Look, I need somebody who can come over
with a net or something.

201
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:39,572
Sure, I'll hold.

202
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,973
Hello? Who's this?

203
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:44,311
Annette.

204
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,679
Look, I got a room
filled with seagulls and... No.

205
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,822
Hi, Phyllis.

206
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:57,025
Goodbye, Phyllis.

207
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,387
Good news.

208
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:01,260
Really? Come tell me in Jake's room.

209
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,192
What did he do?
He didn't paint anything, did he?

210
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,194
I want you to be surprised.

211
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,605
You will never guess what happened
while I was at Judith's.

212
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:13,674
Neither will you.

213
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,235
Oh, my God!

214
00:13:17,746 --> 00:13:19,611
So, what's your good news?

215
00:13:20,449 --> 00:13:21,711
Open the door!

216
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,278
Your kid got them in there,
you get them out.

217
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,151
Open the door!

218
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,724
That was not funny, Charlie.

219
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:39,597
<i>Depends on what side of the door
you were on:</i>

220
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:43,169
Look, I'm really sorry about the birds,

221
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,503
but I'm sure they'll leave
as soon as they get hungry.

222
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,269
That's what I thought about you.

223
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,841
You know what? Jake and I may be
out of here sooner than you think.

224
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:53,847
- What do you mean?
- At Judith's, there was kissing.

225
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,943
Mutual kissing. Unprompted,
but reciprocated by yours truly.

226
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:00,015
Wow.

227
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:01,851
And was it as boring as it sounds?

228
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:04,516
Charlie, she kissed me.

229
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:08,461
This wasn't the kiss of a woman who just
wanted her garbage disposal unclogged.

230
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,697
Well, you know her plumbing
better than I do.

231
00:14:12,801 --> 00:14:15,702
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna let her come to me.

232
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:18,997
You know, be detached,
play it cool. You know?

233
00:14:19,074 --> 00:14:21,042
Yeah. That's your home-run swing.

234
00:14:22,811 --> 00:14:25,507
Hey, Uncle Charlie,
you want to play some sock golf?

235
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:28,080
- No, thanks.
- Where are you going?

236
00:14:28,584 --> 00:14:29,846
I'm going for a drive.

237
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:31,477
- Can I come?
- Nope.

238
00:14:35,991 --> 00:14:38,391
I don't think
Uncle Charlie likes me anymore.

239
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:42,421
Don't be silly.
He's just a little upset about the 30, 40

240
00:14:42,498 --> 00:14:44,523
screaming, crapping birds in his house.

241
00:14:44,867 --> 00:14:47,995
Why don't you write him a note
and tell him how sorry you are?

242
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,262
Okay.

243
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:52,339
Don't worry, he'll come around.

244
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:55,642
Sooner or later, everybody comes around.

245
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:01,446
You just have to give them a little time
and a little space.

246
00:15:03,619 --> 00:15:04,881
Hello, Judith?

247
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:12,750
- What's in the bucket?
- Chum.

248
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,959
- What?
- Bait.

249
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:21,391
I went down to the bait shop
and asked them what seagulls like to eat.

250
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,767
We're keeping them?

251
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:25,930
No. We're gonna throw the bait
out the window

252
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,908
to lure the birds out of the house.

253
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:29,467
That's pretty clever.

254
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,806
Yeah, it's a variation on something I do
with women and tennis bracelets.

255
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:38,411
Hey, Uncle Charlie, I made this for you.

256
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,788
Thanks.

257
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:47,793
I made it myself.

258
00:15:48,731 --> 00:15:49,993
I see that.

259
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:54,394
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting rid of the birds.

260
00:15:54,503 --> 00:15:56,027
- Can I help?
- Nope.

261
00:15:57,306 --> 00:16:00,400
Jake, why don't you go out
and play on the deck, okay?

262
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:01,806
Okay.

263
00:16:05,681 --> 00:16:07,205
What is wrong with you?

264
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:10,012
He worked really hard on that card.
You barely looked at it.

265
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:13,179
- What do you want from me?
- He's dying for you to forgive him.

266
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:15,314
Fine. I forgive him.

267
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:19,057
Now, are you gonna help me or not?
I got a serious problem here.

268
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,726
Really? Because you look like
you have it all together.

269
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,997
Okay, here's the deal.

270
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,834
We go in there and start throwing
this stuff out the windows.

271
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,339
When the last bird's out,

272
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,435
we close the window
and get on with our lives.

273
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:37,842
You're ready?

274
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:40,778
Sure.

275
00:16:41,283 --> 00:16:45,344
You know, if they love this bait so much,
why would they even wait for...

276
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:00,795
It's almost like somebody tipped them off.

277
00:17:01,637 --> 00:17:03,798
- You got any other bright ideas?
- Yeah.

278
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:07,465
I'm gonna get a drywall guy in there
and seal off that room.

279
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:11,477
- Very funny.
- I'm not kidding.

280
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:13,637
That room is dead to me.

281
00:17:15,751 --> 00:17:17,412
Either that or sell the house.

282
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,816
I'll put it on the market
as a two bedroom plus aviary.

283
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:23,784
Everybody loves an aviary.

284
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,554
What about Jake?

285
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:29,495
Are you gonna put him on the market
or just wall him off?

286
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:31,123
I tried with that kid, Alan.

287
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,828
He says one thing,
and then he goes and does another.

288
00:17:33,902 --> 00:17:36,735
He's 10. He's got the attention span
of a hummingbird.

289
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,800
What am I supposed to do
when he ignores me?

290
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,072
You punish him. You take away
his computer, his TV, his toys.

291
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:44,873
You already took away all the good stuff.

292
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,676
What am I supposed to take away?
His bronchial inhaler?

293
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:51,249
You know what I'm saying, Charlie.
You don't take away your love.

294
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:42,297
Hi. I tried calling
but I kept getting your machine,

295
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:45,100
- so I thought I'd bring this over.
- What is it?

296
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:49,577
It's my master file of handymen, plumbers,
electricians, maintenance schedules,

297
00:18:49,645 --> 00:18:52,239
warranties, authorized repair centers,

298
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:54,247
et cetera.

299
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:57,611
Okay, well, you're on your own.
Got to run.

300
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,649
Alan, wait.

301
00:19:03,492 --> 00:19:06,290
- Yes?
- About that kiss?

302
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,625
When you said we should move on,
I got scared, and...

303
00:19:13,836 --> 00:19:15,633
Alan, I kissed you out of fear.

304
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:17,869
Hey, it still counts.

305
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,539
Alan, you were right. We have to move on.

306
00:19:22,878 --> 00:19:24,004
Okay.

307
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,305
Alan, wait.

308
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:33,079
Yes?

309
00:19:33,188 --> 00:19:35,816
The garbage disposal's still making
that horrible noise.

310
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:38,223
I keep telling you not to put bones in it.

311
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:41,018
- I didn't.
- The sink trap does not lie, Judith.

312
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:46,064
This is so cool, Uncle Charlie.

313
00:19:46,368 --> 00:19:49,701
Yeah, I was kind of hard on you,
and I wanted to make it up.

314
00:19:50,706 --> 00:19:52,765
So, you're not still mad
about the seagulls?

315
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:56,072
I'm still mad. I just figured out
a better way to deal with it.

316
00:19:56,311 --> 00:19:58,575
Well, I think this is a very good way.

317
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:02,245
Me, too.

318
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:04,016
I'm buying you all this stuff,

319
00:20:04,086 --> 00:20:07,419
but as punishment for letting seagulls
in my house,

320
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:09,389
you can't play with it for a month.

321
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,891
A month?

322
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:12,617
Pretty smart, huh?

323
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:15,153
It's not fair.

324
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:17,898
You know what this is?

325
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,233
The world's smallest violin.

326
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:25,139
What are you talking about?

327
00:20:35,017 --> 00:20:36,484
They're gone, Charlie.

328
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,652
Are you sure? Check under the bed.

329
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,451
All clear.

330
00:20:46,461 --> 00:20:47,792
Okay.

331
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,029
I wonder why they left.

332
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:52,066
Maybe because we stopped feeding them.

333
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:55,225
Whoa, check it out.

334
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,171
Wow.

335
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,242
- You know what this means, don't you?
- Yeah.

336
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:05,039
Breakfast.

337
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:32,433
English
