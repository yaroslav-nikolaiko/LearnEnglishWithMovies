1
00:00:01,923 --> 00:00:05,196
I want you to tell me
the truth about Joffrey.

2
00:00:05,522 --> 00:00:06,872
He's a monster.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:11,448
With the Tyrells beside us, no one
will think of rebelling for another century.

4
00:00:11,568 --> 00:00:13,635
Ser Dontos of House Hollard.

5
00:00:13,755 --> 00:00:15,770
Ser Meryn, help Ser Dontos
celebrate my name day.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,640
It would be bad luck to kill a man
on your name day.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,160
You'll be my new fool!

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,432
Thank you, Your Grace.

9
00:00:21,552 --> 00:00:23,976
Do you know
what it takes to unite 19 clans?

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,597
I told them we were all going to die

11
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:28,350
if we don't get south.

12
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:31,828
Let us go, and my father will pay you
whatever you want.

13
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,736
Enough to buy me a new head?

14
00:00:39,826 --> 00:00:41,959
_

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,275
_

16
00:00:49,909 --> 00:00:52,119
We need to find Sansa Stark a husband.

17
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,641
Tyrion'll do as he's bid,
you'll marry Ser Loras.

18
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:57,472
— I am not some brood mare...
— You're my daughter!

19
00:00:57,592 --> 00:00:59,857
My feelings for you have not changed.

20
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,086
I'm not your lady,
I'm your whore.

21
00:01:02,377 --> 00:01:04,336
He's a crow, he'll stab us in the back.

22
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:05,712
Kill him!

23
00:58:49,523 --> 00:59:00,032
